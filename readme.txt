Model Execution
Open the code folder.
Replace all file paths in inits.py and ResCLGATEns.py with the corresponding file paths of the HMDAD or Disbiome dataset on your local machine.
For example: In inits.py, there is a path like D:/python-study/Res/model_zoo/ResCLGATEns/data/HMDAD/cache.npz. You only need to replace the prefix part (D:/python-study/Res/model_zoo/ResCLGATEns/data) with the actual path of this directory on your own computer.
Run the model directly, and the results will be generated automatically.
